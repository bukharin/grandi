# Grandi
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) native bindings to NewTek NDI(tm). For more information on NDI(tm), see:

https://www.ndi.tv/

This module allows a Node.js program to find, receive and send NDI(tm) video, audio and metadata streams over IP networks. All calls are asynchronous and use JavaScript promises with all of the underlying work of NDI running on separate threads from the event loop.

NDI(tm) is a realisation of a grand vision for what IP media streams should and can be.

Fork Information
----------------

Grandi is a maintained fork of the original [Streampunk Grandiose](https://github.com/Streampunk/grandiose) project. It keeps the familiar API while modernizing the codebase and expanding functionality:

- TypeScript-focused rewrite with complete binding coverage.
- Improved NDI SDK handling (versioning, download/packaging, and portability improvements).
- Added utilities to make common workflows easier.
- audio frame sending support from the [rse/grandiose](https://github.com/rse/grandiose) fork.
- ad-hoc download of NDI SDK from the [rse/grandiose](https://github.com/rse/grandiose) fork.
- Portability fixes for clean compile under Windows, macOS and Linux from the [rse/grandiose](https://github.com/rse/grandiose) fork.
- Portability fixes for macOS from the [danjenkins/grandiose](https://github.com/danjenkins/grandiose) fork.
- NDI Sender functionality from the [ianshade/grandiose](https://github.com/ianshade/grandiose) fork.
- Initial TypeScript type definitions from the [ianshade/grandiose](https://github.com/ianshade/grandiose) fork.
- NDI Routing functionality from the [hopejr/grandiose](https://github.com/hopejr/grandiose) fork.

## Installation

Grandi supports the Windows/x86, Windows/x64, macOS/x64, Linux/x86 and Linux/x64 platforms at this time only.

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for your platform. This software has been developed against the long term stable (LTS) release.

On Windows, the NDI(tm) DLL requires that the Visual Studio 2013 C run-times are installed, available from:

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784

Grandi is designed to be `require`d to use from your own application to provide async processing. For example:

    npm install --save grandi

## Using Grandi

### Finding streams

A list of all currently available NDI(tm) sources available on the current local area network (or VLAN) can be retrieved. For example, to print a list of sources to the console, try:

```javascript
const grandi = require('grandi');

grandi.find()
  .then(console.log)
  .catch(console.error);
```

The result is an array, for example here are some local sources to machine :

```javascript
[ { name: 'GINGER (Intel(R) HD Graphics 520 1)',
    urlAddress: '169.254.82.1:5962' },
  { name: 'GINGER (Test Pattern)',
    urlAddress: '169.254.82.1:5961' },
  { name: 'GINGER (TOSHIBA Web Camera - HD)',
    urlAddress: '169.254.82.1:5963' } ]
```

The find operation can be configured with an options object and a wait time in measured in milliseconds:

    grandi.find(<opts>, <wait_time>);

The options are as follows:

```javascript
grandi.find({
  // Should sources on the same system be found?
  showLocalSources: true,
  // Show only sources in a named group. May be an array.
  groups: "studio3",
  // Specific IP addresses or machine names to check
  // These are possibly on a different VLAN and not visible over MDNS
  extraIPs: [ "192.168.1.122", "mixer.studio7.zbc.com" ]
}) // ...
```

### Receiving streams

First of all, find a stream using the method above or create an object representing a source:

```javascript
const grandi = require('grandi');
let source = { name: "<source_name>", urlAddress: "<IP-address>:<port>" };
```

In an `async` function, create a receiver as follows:

```javascript
let receiver = await grandi.receive({ source: source });
```

An example of the receiver object resolved by this promise is shown below:

```javascript
{ embedded: [External],
  video: [Function: video],
  audio: [Function: audio],
  metadata: [Function: metadata],
  data: [Function: data],
  source:
   { name: 'LEMARR (Test Pattern)',
     urlAddress: '169.254.82.1:5961' },
  colorFormat: 100, // grandi.COLOR_FORMAT_FASTEST
  bandwidth: 100,   // grandi.BANDWIDTH_HIGHEST
  allowVideoFields: true }
```

The `embedded` value is the native receiver returned by the NDI(tm) SDK. The `video`, `audio`, `metadata` and `data` functions return promises to retrieve data from the source. These promises are backed by calls that are thread safe.

The `colorFormat`, `bandwidth` and `allowVideoFields` parameters are those used to set up the receiver. These can be configured as options when creating the receiver as follows:

```javascript
let receiver = await grandi.receive({
  source: source, // required source parameter
  // Preferred colour space - without and with alpha channel
  // One of COLOR_FORMAT_RGBX_RGBA, COLOR_FORMAT_BGRX_BGRA,
  //   COLOR_FORMAT_UYVY_RGBA, COLOR_FORMAT_UYVY_BGRA or
  //   the default of COLOR_FORMAT_FASTEST
  colorFormat: grandi.COLOR_FORMAT_UYVY_RGBA,
  // Select bandwidth level. One of grandi.BANDWIDTH_METADATA_ONLY,
  //   BANDWIDTH_AUDIO_ONLY, BANDWIDTH_LOWEST and the default value
  //   of BANDWIDTH_HIGHEST
  bandwidth: grandi.BANDWIDTH_AUDIO_ONLY,
  // Set to false to receive only progressive video frames
  allowVideoFields: true, // default is true
  // An optional name for the receiver, otherwise one will be generated
  name: "rooftop"
}, );
```

#### Video

Request video frames from the source as follows:

```javascript
let timeout = 5000; // Optional timeout, default is 10000ms
try {
  for ( let x = 0 ; x < 10 ; x++) {
    let videoFrame = await receiver.video(timeout);
    console.log(videoFrame);
  }
} catch (e) { console.error(e); }
```

Here is the output associated with a video frame created by an NDI(tm) test pattern:

```javascript
{ type: 'video',
  xres: 1920,
  yres: 1080,
  frameRateN: 30000,
  frameRateD: 1001,
  pictureAspectRatio: 1.7777777910232544, // 16:9
  timestamp: [ 1538569443, 717845600 ], // PTP timestamp
  frameFormatType: 1, // grandi.FORMAT_TYPE_INTERLACED
  timecode: [ 0, 0 ], // Measured in nanoseconds
  lineStrideBytes: 3840,
  data: <Buffer 80 10 80 10 80 10 80 10 ... > }
```

NDI presents 8-bit integer data for video.

Note that the returned promise may be rejected if the request times out or another error occurs.

The `receiver` instance will disconnect on the next garbage collection, so make sure that you don't hold onto a reference.

#### Audio

Audio follows a similar pattern to video, except that a couple of options are available to control for format of audio returned into Javasript.

```javascript
let timeout = 8000; // Optional timeout value in ms
let audioFrame = await receiver.audio({
    // One of three audio formats that NDI(tm) utilities can provide:
    //  grandi.AUDIO_FORMAT_INT_16_INTERLEAVED,
    //  AUDIO_FORMAT_FLOAT_32_INTERLEAVED and the default value of
    //  AUDIO_FORMAT_FLOAT_32_SEPARATE
    audioFormat: grandi.AUDIO_FORMAT_INT_16_INTERLEAVED,
    // The audio reference level in dB. This specifies how many dB above
    // the reference level (+4dBU) is the full range of integer audio.
    referenceLevel: 0 // default is 0dB
  }, timeout);
```

An example of an audio frame resolved from this promise is:

```javascript
{ type: 'audio',
  audioFormat: 2, // grandi.AUDIO_FORMAT_INT_16_INTERLEAVED
  referenceLevel: 0, // 0dB above reference level
  sampleRate: 48000, // Hz
  channels: 4,
  samples: 4800, // Number of samples in this frame
  channelStrideInBytes: 9600, // number of bytes per channel in buffer
  timestamp: [ 1538578787, 132614500 ], // PTP timestamp
  timecode: [ 0, 800000000 ], // timecode as PTP value
  data: <Buffer 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 89 0a 89 0a 89 0a 89 0 ... > }
```

#### Metadata

Follows a similar pattern to video and audio, waiting for any metadata messages in the stream.

```javascript
let metadataFrame = await receiver.metadata();
```

Result is an object with a data property that is string containing the metadata, expected to be a short XML document.

#### Next available data

A means to receive the next available data payload in the stream, whether that is video, audio or metadata, allowing the application to filter the streams as required based on the `type` parameter. The optional arguments used for audio can also be used here.

```javascript
let dataFrame = await receiver.data();
if (dataFrame.type == 'video') { /* Process just the video */ }
else if (dataFrame.type == 'metadata') { console.log(dataFrame.data); }
```
